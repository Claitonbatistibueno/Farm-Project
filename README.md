  <summary><b>💡 Why was this project built? (The Market Problem)</b></summary>
  <br>
  The Irish agricultural sector has over 135,000 active farms, but many small and medium beef producers struggle with tight margins due to volatile feed and energy costs. Most existing management software is built for massive, industrial dairy operations—leaving family farms to manage their herds based on rough national averages rather than individual data.
  <br><br>
  <b>Farm-Project</b> was built to fix this "black box." It brings individual financial traceability, fattening optimization, and predictive Veterinary AI to the everyday farmer, designed to work even in offline rural environments.

Welcome to **Farm-Project**! This is a complete agricultural management system focused on animal tracking, health monitoring, feeding control, financial management, comprehensive reporting, and Artificial Intelligence integration for predictions and visual analysis.

## 🌟 Main Features

* **Authentication & Access:** Secure login system (`login.php`) starting from the main entry point (`index.html`).
* **Central Dashboard:** System overview (`dashboard.php`).
* **Financial Hub:** Financial management and overview (`financial_dashboard.php`).
* **Comprehensive Reports (`reports.php`):**
    * **Animal Reports:** Detailed herd reports and history (`reports_animals.php`).
    * **Feeding Reports:** Animal nutrition history and management (`reports_feeding.php`).
    * **Health Reports:** Health data tracking (`reports_health.php`).
    * **Financial Reports:** Detailed financial tracking and summaries (`reports_financial.php`).
* **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Integration:**
    * Computer vision analysis (`ai_vision.php`).
    * AI prediction module (`previsao_ia.py`).
    * Data logging and analysis in JSON (`ai_analysis.json`).
    * Debug tools and logs (`debug_ai.php`, `ai_error_log.txt`).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML
* **Backend:** PHP
* **Artificial Intelligence/Scripts:** Python
* **Database:** SQL (MySQL/MariaDB)
* **Data Structure:** JSON

## 🚀 How to Setup and Run (Basic Guide)

1. **Database:**
    * Create a database on your local server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or web server).
    * Import the `farmproject.sql` file to recreate the necessary tables.
2. **Web Server & Access:**
    * Place the project files in your server's public directory (e.g., the `htdocs` folder in XAMPP).
    * **System Entry:** Access the system through your web browser by opening `index.html`.
    * You will be directed to the login screen (`login.php`). Simply enter your credentials to authenticate and gain access to the dashboard and all other system routines.
3. **AI Modules (Python):**
    * Make sure you have Python installed in your environment.
    * Run the `previsao_ia.py` script as needed to feed data into the system.

## ⚠️ Development Notes

* Log files (`ai_error_log.txt`) and debug files (`debug_ai.php`) are included to help identify issues in AI integrations.
* Ensure database credentials are correctly configured in the PHP files before using in production.
